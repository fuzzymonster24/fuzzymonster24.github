    <h3><em>Zoonotic infections cause 2.2 million deaths every year and are on the rise. Are we underestimating their threat? And are we doing enough to prevent them?</em></h3></div>

A zoonotic infection occurs when a disease causing organism (pathogen) jumps from an animal to a human. The Centre for Disease Control (USA) estimates that more than six in every ten infectious diseases originated in animals. Given their prevalence, it’s unsurpising that we’re very familiar with zoonotic diseases such as ebola, rabies and bird flu. </p>

<p>SARS-Cov-2, the virus responsible for the current Covid-19 pandemic, was thought to originate from a similar coronavirus in bats. The death of over 4.25 million covid-19 patients worldwide is a bleak reminder of the deadly threat zoonotic infections pose to humans.</p>

<p>Across the globe, different animal species can act as reservoirs of zoonotic disease. These reservoirs are the habitats or hosts in which an infectious agent can live, grow and multiply. As long as such reservoirs exist they can act as a source of further infection.</p>

<p>Just as it’s much easier to jump across a puddle than a river - the closer animals are to humans, the easier it is for zoonotic pathogens to make the jump across species. As our population increases, humans and wildlife are becoming increasingly interconnected. This betters the odds that zoonotic pathogens can overcome a species barrier to infect us.</p>

<p>The risk of zoonotic infection is especially great for poor and marginalised populations, who are forced to live on the border between cities and wild areas. In changing our land use, we’ve changed the way we interact with animals, increasing our vulnerability to zoonotic diseases.</p> 

<p>It’s vital that further research is conducted to understand just how animal viruses and parasites can jump across species boundaries and infect humans. Such knowledge might help to prevent any future pandemic caused by zoonotic events. </p>

<p>We also need to pay attention to the immediate dangers of continuing our close interaction with the natural world. Understanding the interface between human populations, wildlife health and ecosystems is an essential part of understanding how zoonotic infections can arise and spread. </p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us that we can no longer ignore the consequences of zoonotic infection. We can only hope that scientific research can out-pace the next animal pathogen that makes the jump to infect humans.
