    <h3><em>The start of an awful joke, or an interesting biological question?</em></h3></div>

            <p>Scientists have discovered that Big Blue Octopuses (Octopus cyanea) partner up with coral reef fishes to find food. Both the octopus and its numerous partners benefit from their interactions with each other. But recent research suggests these relationships can easily turn salty. Octopuses lash out at fish thought to be flouting the rules of the hunting alliance.
            </p>
            
            <p>Such partnerships in nature are rare and complex, offering an impressive example of communication between different species. This particular hunting partnership has evovled from a reliance on the different strengths of different aquatic species to generate greater success for finding food.</p>
            
            <p>The octopuses provide speed and agility. They can dart around rocks and into tight spaces in the reef that fish simply can’t reach. Groupers and Goatfishes use gestures to signal prey locations to the Octopuses, whilst other fish patrol the surrounding area. Once the fish show the octopus where to find food, a meal gets shared equally. </p>
            
            <p>The situation is similar to you baking a cake with your friends. One person might buy the ingredients. You might be amazing at mixing all the ingredients together. Another may know the best temperature and timings for cooking the cake. Through relying on your different strengths, everyone can contribute to a much better cake than you would have been able to produce individually.</p>
            
            <p>It’s all going swimmingly until... you spot someone taking a larger slice of the cake than yours. Seems unfair right? Similar conflicts occur when an Octopus considers one of the hunting partners to be taking more than their fair share of food. Whilst you might have a quick chat to the greedy cake maker, these octopuses tend to resolve their dispute with violence.</p>

        <div class="main_text">
            <p>Octopuses throw punches at specific fish that might be cheating the rules of the hunting aliance. One explanation is that the octopuses punch fish out of spite. That is they deliberately perform an action that has negative consequences for both themselves and for their victim.</p>

            <p>Punching a fish costs an octopus energy. The cost to the fish is the loss of any immediate opportunity to catch prey, a demotion to a worse location or even permanent eviction from the group.</p>
            
            <p>However, it is possible that there is a hidden benefit to the octopus punching fish as a mechanism to control their hunting partners. Punching is speculated to act as a ‘punishment’ for the fish. The behaviour may have emerged to help prevent exploitation by the fish and ensure better collaboration in the future.</p>
            
            <p>Giving your greedy friend a nudge off their slice might make your friendship a bit awkward for a bit. But at least you can hope to get a decent slice of cake next time.</p>

        <p>The research discussed in this article has been published in the journal <a id="paper" href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3266">Ecology</a>. It’s hoped that further research into these interactions can reveal a more concrete explanation for why these fishes suffer from the sucker punch of octopuses.
